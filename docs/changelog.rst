Changelog
=========
1.4
---
* Removed undocumented pytest.load_fixture: If you need this feature, just use
  ``django.management.call_command('loaddata', 'foo.json')`` instead.

* Make the plugin behave gracefully without DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE
  specified.  ``py.test`` will still work and tests needing django
  features will skip.

* Allow specifying of DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE on the command line and
  py.test ini configuration file as well as the environment variable.

* Do not allow database access in tests by default.  Introduce
  ``pytest.mark.djangodb`` to enable database access.

* Deprecate the ``transaction_test_case`` decorator, this is now
  integrated with the ``djangodb`` mark.

1.3
---
* Added ``--reuse-db`` and ``--create-db`` to allow database re-use. Many
  thanks to `django-nose <https://github.com/jbalogh/django-nose>`_ for
  code and inspiration for this feature.
