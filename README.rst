Install pytest-django
---------------------

::

    pip install pytest-django

Why would I use this instead of Django's `manage.py test` command?
------------------------------------------------------------------

Running your test suite with pytest-django allows you to tap into the features
that are already present in pytest. Here are some advantages:

* `Manage test dependencies with pytest fixtures. <http://pytest.org/latest/fixture.html>`_
* Less boilerplate tests: no need to import unittest, create a subclass with methods. Write tests as regular functions.
* Database re-use: no need to re-create the test database for every test run.
* Run tests in multiple processes for increased speed (with the pytest-xdist plugin).
* Make use of other `pytest plugins <http://pytest.org/latest/plugins.html>`_.
* Works with both worlds: Existing unittest-style TestCase's still work without any modifications.

See the `pytest documentation <http://pytest.org/latest/>`_ for more information on pytest itself.
