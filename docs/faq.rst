.. _faq-import-error:

I see an error saying "could not import myproject.settings"
-----------------------------------------------------------

pytest-django tries to automatically add your project to the Python path by
looking for a ``manage.py`` file and adding its path to the Python path.

If this for some reason fails for you, you have to manage your Python paths
explicitly. See the documentation on :ref:`managing_the_python_path_explicitly`
for more information.

How can I make sure that all my tests run with a specific locale?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Create a `pytest fixture <http://pytest.org/latest/fixture.html>`_ that is
automatically run before each test case. To run all tests with the english
locale, put the following code in your project's `conftest.py
<http://pytest.org/latest/plugins.html>`_ file::

    from django.utils.translation import activate

    @pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
    def set_default_language():
        activate('en')

.. _faq-tests-not-being-picked-up:

My tests are not being found. Why not?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 By default, py.test looks for tests in files named ``test_*.py`` (note that
 this is not the same as ``test*.py``).  If you have your tests in files with
 other names, they will not be collected. It is common to put tests under
 ``app_directory/tests/views.py``. To find those tests, create a ``pytest.ini``
 file in your project root with the contents::

    [pytest]
    python_files=*.py

When debugging test collection problems, the ``--collectonly`` flag and ``-rs``
(report skipped tests) can be helpful.

Does pytest-django work with the pytest-xdist plugin?
-----------------------------------------------------

Yes. pytest-django supports running tests in parallel with pytest-xdist. Each
process created by xdist gets its own separate database that is used for the
tests. This ensures that each test can run independently, regardless of wheter
transactions are tested or not.

How can I use ``manage.py test`` with pytest-django?
----------------------------------------------------

pytest-django is designed to work with the ``py.test`` command, but if you
really need integration with ``manage.py test``, you can create a simple
test runner like this::

    class PytestTestRunner(object):
        """Runs pytest to discover and run tests."""

        def __init__(self, verbosity=1, failfast=False, keepdb=False, **kwargs):
            self.verbosity = verbosity
            self.failfast = failfast
            self.keepdb = keepdb

        def run_tests(self, test_labels):
            """Run pytest and return the exitcode.

            It translates some of Django's test command option to pytest's.
            """
            import pytest

            argv = []
            if self.verbosity == 0:
                argv.append('--quiet')
            if self.verbosity == 2:
                argv.append('--verbose')
            if self.failfast:
                argv.append('--exitfirst')
            if self.keepdb:
                argv.append('--reuse-db')

            argv.extend(test_labels)
            return pytest.main(argv)

Add the path to this class in your Django settings::

    TEST_RUNNER = 'my_project.runner.PyTestRunner'

Usage::

    ./manage.py test <django args> -- <py.test args>

**Note**: the pytest-django command line options ``--ds`` and ``--dc`` are not
compatible with this approach, you need to use the standard Django methods of
setting the ``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE``/``DJANGO_CONFIGURATION`` environmental
variables or the ``--settings`` command line option.

How/where can I get help with pytest/pytest-django?
